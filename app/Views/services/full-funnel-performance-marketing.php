					<p>The traditional marketing funnel works excellent as a simple way to illustrate the various stages of marketing, from creating awareness to post-purchase follow-up. </p>
					<p>But, it's crucial to note that not all customers will progress through the funnel in the same way. Some may contact your brand at the bottom of the funnel; others may enter at the top. That's why it's important to have a full-funnel marketing strategy. </p>
				</div>

			<div class="col-md-6">
				<div class="wt-is-ff-points">
					<p>This type of strategy considers all the different ways customers can engage with your brand and seeks to create a consistent experience regardless of where they are in the funnel. </p>
					<p>As a result, full-funnel marketing helps to ensure that no customer falls through the cracks and that everyone has a positive experience.</p>

						<h4>Consideration</h4>
