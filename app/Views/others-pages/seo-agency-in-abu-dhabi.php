Paid search results are the ads that show at the top and to the right of organic results. Businesses are able to show their website very quickly in search results, and SEO companies work with site owners to help the sites rank higher so that they can receive more traffic from the organic listings. A good SEO campaign will increase organic traffic, leads, and sales by improving visibility in organic search results.</p>
