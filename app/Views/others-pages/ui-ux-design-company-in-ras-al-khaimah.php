								<p>User research is the fundamental step of our UI/UX design process. Research and requirements gathering is performed on a group of users from various backgrounds and demographics to understand if the product will meet the needs of the target audience. </p>

								<p>We build user personas of our target audience through online research and web analytics. User personas represent real people, their expectations, universal features, and their interaction with the website.</p>
