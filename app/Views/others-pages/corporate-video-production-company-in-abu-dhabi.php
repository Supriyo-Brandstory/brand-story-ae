                        This stage involves developing a timeline for your video production, crafting a storyboard,
                        drafting a script, and preparing any other necessary tools to ensure a smooth production process
                        when filming begins. This is the first step in the process of corporate videography Abu Dhabi

                    <h3>Production</h3>
                    <p class="mb-0">During this phase of video production, shooting the actual video takes place when
                        you have a detailed script and storyboard. BrandStory simplifies this stage by scouting the
                        location beforehand to ensure the lighting and acoustics match your concept.</p>

                        process. This stage involves fine-tuning your video by cutting unnecessary footage, mixing and
                        editing vocals, music, and other sounds, and adding special effects and graphics to enhance the
                        complete quality of your video. The goal is to achieve a polished and professional look that

                        Typically, producing a corporate video requires approximately 4-6 weeks to complete. This
                        includes the various stages of development, pre-production, filming, post-production, and
                        editing. However, if the video exceeds 5 minutes, the timeline may be extended to approximately
                        eight weeks.
