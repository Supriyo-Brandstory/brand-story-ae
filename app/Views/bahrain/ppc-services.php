					<div class="accordion-body">
						PPC or Pay-per-click advertising is an advertising form where a set budget is allocated for
						running your ads on a given platform like Google. Payment is made depending on the number of
						clicks received. PPC works mainly through Google Ads. When someone clicks on your ads in Google,
						you must pay the CPC amount or the cost per click to Google. Google runs your ads until your
						funds last. Search ads are the most common forms of PPC ads. These ads are posted near the
						Google search results so that they immediately catch the eye of the user. You have to get your
						ad copy ready, select keywords and pay to set up a Search Ad campaign.

						<p>The key difference between SEO and PPC is that the traffic coming in through SEO is organic
							and free while that from PPC is paid for, on the basis of cost per click.</p>
						<p>With SEO, you can get the position in the first page only through search engine optimization.
							With PPC, you can get position in the first results page by paying more cost per click.</p>
						<p>SEO works best to get traffic by hiring an SEO expert. But PPC depends on several other
							factors to work such as popularity of keywords, advertisers who use the keyword, and so on.

						<p>Overall SEO may get more traffic than PPC because if the keywords on your website have higher
							ranks, you will automatically get in traffic to your website without paying for those
